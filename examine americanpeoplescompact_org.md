# Analysis of the American People's Compact: Examining Claims of Nonpartisanship

## Overview

The American People's Compact presents itself as a nonpartisan policy platform. It addresses 16 major areas including economic security, education, healthcare, democracy reform, and climate action. The organization claims that "nearly 8 in 10 Americans, Democrats and Republicans alike" support the platform. This analysis examines whether the Compact truly represents nonpartisan consensus or reflects partisan priorities under a neutral label.[^1]

## The Steel Man Argument FOR Nonpartisanship

**The case that the APC is genuinely nonpartisan rests on several strong pillars.**

**First, the policy substance aligns with documented public opinion across party lines.** Multiple independent polls confirm broad bipartisan support for many APC proposals. Universal background checks for firearms enjoy 85-90% overall support, including 79-80% of Republicans and 88-90% of Democrats. Medicare drug price negotiation receives 75-83% overall support, with 65-75% of Republicans and 79-95% of Democrats backing it. Congressional term limits command 80-83% support overall, including 85-86% of Republicans and 79-80% of Democrats.[^2][^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12][^13]

Campaign finance reform shows similarly strong bipartisan backing. Some 77-82% of Americans support a constitutional amendment to limit money in politics, including majorities across partisan lines. Even specific immigration reforms with pathways to citizenship receive 67% overall support when properly structured, with substantial backing from both parties.[^14][^15][^16][^17][^18]

**Second, the policy framing emphasizes pragmatic solutions over ideological positioning.** The APC consistently focuses on outcomes rather than partisan talking points. On climate policy, for instance, it emphasizes "practical, bipartisan solutions" like grid modernization and disaster preparedness rather than carbon taxes or Green New Deal rhetoric. The immigration section balances border security with legal pathways, addressing concerns from both left and right.[^1]

The education proposals avoid culture war flashpoints. Instead of taking sides on controversial curriculum debates, the APC emphasizes universal goals like teacher pay, resource equity, and critical thinking skills. The healthcare section pursues "universal, affordable healthcare" through incremental reforms rather than demanding single-payer systems or defending private insurance monopolies.[^1]

**Third, the partner organizations span the political spectrum.** The APC lists Braver Angels as an official partner. Braver Angels is explicitly dedicated to bridging partisan divides and describes itself as bringing "reds and blues" together for respectful dialogue. This organization has conducted workshops across Michigan and other swing states specifically to reduce political polarization. The inclusion of such a genuinely nonpartisan bridge-building organization suggests the APC operates in good faith.[^19][^20][^21][^22][^1]

**Fourth, the policies address legitimate market failures and collective action problems that ideology cannot solve.** Housing affordability, prescription drug costs, and infrastructure decay are not partisan issues—they are governance challenges that require pragmatic solutions. Polling shows 71% support for zoning reforms to enable more housing, and bipartisan majorities favor policies to increase housing supply. These are technical problems with technical solutions that transcend left-right divides.[^23][^24][^25][^26][^1]

**Fifth, the emphasis on transparency and democratic reform benefits all citizens regardless of ideology.** Ending gerrymandering, reducing dark money, protecting voting rights, and strengthening ethics oversight make government more accountable to everyone. Some 83% of Americans want stronger enforcement of campaign finance laws, with two-thirds support across party lines. These reforms do not inherently favor one party over another—they favor voters over entrenched interests.[^15][^1]

## The Steel Man Argument AGAINST Nonpartisanship

**The case that the APC reflects partisan priorities disguised as consensus rests on equally substantial evidence.**

**First, the organizational partnerships reveal a clear left-leaning alignment.** While Braver Angels is genuinely nonpartisan, Statewide Indivisible Michigan explicitly identifies as a "left-of-center" coalition. Indivisible Michigan was founded by Democratic activists and works closely with the Michigan Democratic Party to elect Democrats and advance Democratic policy priorities. The organization supported progressive ballot measures and opposed Republican policies throughout its history.[^27][^28]

The Indivisible Project nationally is a 501(c)(4) organization focused on progressive activism. It emerged after the 2016 election specifically to resist the Trump agenda. Its candidate endorsements overwhelmingly favor Democrats. The inclusion of this explicitly left-wing organization as an official partner contradicts claims of nonpartisanship.[^29][^30][^31][^32]

**Second, many policy positions closely match Democratic Party platforms while departing from Republican priorities.** The healthcare section calls for "universal, affordable healthcare" with strong government regulation and price controls. While 88% of Democrats believe government should ensure healthcare for all Americans, only 28% of Republicans agree—a 60-point gap. The APC's healthcare vision aligns with the Democratic majority view, not a bipartisan consensus.[^33][^1]

On climate policy, the partisan gap has widened to 38 percentage points as of 2024, the largest in polling history. While the APC emphasizes bipartisan policies like tree planting and renewable tax breaks, its overall framing prioritizes "tackling climate change" and "rising global temperatures" as urgent threats. Some 95% of Democrats but only 57% of Republicans endorse U.S. government action on climate. The APC's climate section reflects the more expansive Democratic view rather than finding middle ground.[^34][^1]

The education proposals emphasize equity funding, fact-based secular curricula, teaching "difficult chapters" of American history fully, and protecting against "censorship and book bans". These specific framings align with Democratic talking points on critical race theory debates and book challenges. The APC takes clear positions on what Republicans view as progressive overreach in education policy.[^1]

**Third, conspicuous absences reveal ideological priorities.** The APC includes no provisions protecting Second Amendment rights, even though such language appears in many bipartisan compromise proposals. It does not address concerns about government overreach, regulatory burden on small businesses, or the role of faith communities—themes that typically appear in genuinely bipartisan documents seeking Republican buy-in.[^1]

The immigration section prioritizes "earned legalization" for undocumented residents while treating deportation as exceptional rather than routine enforcement. This framing aligns with Democratic immigration priorities. A genuinely balanced approach would give equal weight to enforcement concerns and pathway provisions.[^1]

**Fourth, the funding and organizational transparency remain unclear.** Despite emphasizing transparency as a core value, the APC website provides no information about who created the Compact, who funds it, or how it operates organizationally. This opacity contrasts sharply with the disclosure standards the Compact itself advocates for political organizations. The lack of transparency enables partisan actors to promote their agenda under a nonpartisan label without accountability.[^1]

Many ostensibly nonpartisan think tanks and advocacy organizations actually receive substantial funding from ideologically aligned sources. The Center for American Progress, for example, describes itself as nonpartisan but was founded by Democratic operative John Podesta and explicitly promotes "progressive ideas". Without disclosure of the APC's structure and funding, similar concerns arise.[^35][^36][^37]

**Fifth, the emphasis on "evidence-based" and "fact-based" policy subtly frames conservative positions as ignorant or anti-science.** The APC repeatedly invokes these terms while advocating specific policy positions. This rhetorical strategy treats policy differences as knowledge deficits rather than value disagreements. Reasonable people can disagree about the proper balance between individual liberty and collective action, or between federal authority and local control, without being anti-evidence or anti-fact.[^1]

The document's tone suggests that opposition comes from special interests and corporate lobbying rather than legitimate philosophical differences. This framing delegitimizes conservative arguments without engaging their substance. A genuinely nonpartisan document would acknowledge that good-faith Americans disagree on fundamental questions about the role of government in society.[^1]

## Synthesis: Evaluating the Claims

**The most accurate assessment is that the APC represents genuine policy consensus on some issues while advocating partisan priorities on others, all wrapped in nonpartisan framing.**

**Valid elements supporting nonpartisanship:**

The polling evidence for bipartisan support on specific policies is robust and undeniable. Background checks for firearms, Medicare drug price negotiation, congressional term limits, and campaign finance reform genuinely command supermajority support across party lines. The APC correctly identifies these as areas where public opinion has converged.[^3][^4][^5][^6][^7][^8][^9][^10][^11][^12][^13][^2]

Housing affordability and zoning reform also show genuine bipartisan support when framed as practical solutions to supply shortages. Education funding for public schools receives majority support even among Trump voters. Immigration reform with both border security and legal pathways attracts broad backing.[^38][^39][^16][^24][^17][^25][^18][^26][^23]

These represent real opportunities for bipartisan policy action. The APC performs a valuable service by compiling these consensus positions in one document.

**Valid critiques of partisan bias:**

However, the organizational partnerships undermine credibility. Statewide Indivisible Michigan is explicitly left-wing and works to elect Democrats. This partnership reveals the APC's true political alignment. A genuinely nonpartisan initiative would partner only with organizations like Braver Angels that refuse to take partisan positions.[^28][^27]

The healthcare and climate sections reflect Democratic priorities more than genuine consensus. The 60-point partisan gap on government's role in healthcare and the 38-point gap on climate action demonstrate that these remain deeply divisive issues. Presenting them as consensus positions is misleading.[^34][^33]

The lack of organizational transparency is a serious problem. A document demanding disclosure from others should disclose its own funding, governance, and creation process. This opacity suggests the APC may be a partisan project using nonpartisan branding for political advantage.[^1]

**Key distinction: Policy support versus policy packaging:**

The evidence suggests Americans agree on many individual policies but disagree on their priority, scope, and philosophical justification. For example, while 75% of Republicans favor tax credits for home energy efficiency and 69% support carbon capture technology, only 47% support carbon taxes and 38% support requiring power plants to eliminate all emissions by 2040. The APC bundles popular incremental policies with more controversial systemic changes.[^40]

Similarly, 80% of Republicans support universal background checks and 54% support gun licensing, but the APC frames these within a broader gun safety agenda that includes other measures Republicans oppose. The packaging matters as much as the individual components.[^3]

**The role of framing and emphasis:**

The APC's language choices reveal ideological leanings. Terms like "evidence-based," "fact-based," and "secular curricula" signal progressive values while implicitly casting conservative positions as ignorant or theocratic. The emphasis on "bodily autonomy" clearly references abortion rights without naming them explicitly. The warning about "rising global temperatures" prioritizes climate urgency over economic trade-offs.[^1]

A genuinely nonpartisan document would use neutral language that both conservatives and progressives could embrace. It would acknowledge legitimate value disagreements rather than treating policy differences as factual disputes.

**Conclusion:**

The American People's Compact is best understood as a progressive policy agenda that incorporates genuinely bipartisan proposals. It identifies real areas of public consensus and packages them with more partisan positions. The partnership with Indivisible Michigan exposes its left-leaning organizational base, while the partnership with Braver Angels provides nonpartisan credibility.

The document's value lies in highlighting specific policies with authentic bipartisan support—background checks, drug price negotiation, term limits, campaign finance reform, housing supply expansion, and border security combined with legal immigration pathways. These represent legitimate opportunities for legislative action.

However, the broader vision reflects Democratic priorities on healthcare, climate, education, and social justice. The lack of transparency about funding and organization undermines trust. Americans who examine the APC should distinguish between individual policies with genuine consensus and the overall package, which advances a progressive worldview despite nonpartisan branding.

The most constructive approach is to extract the genuinely bipartisan policies for immediate action while continuing to debate the more divisive proposals through normal democratic processes. This allows us to build on real consensus without pretending that deeper disagreements have vanished.
